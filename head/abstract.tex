\chapter*{Abstract}

A new generation of colliders capable of reaching TeV energies is presently under development, and to succeed in this task it is necessary to show that the technology for such a machine is available. The Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) is a possible design option among the future lepton collider projects. It consists of two normal-conducting linacs. Accelerating structures with a gradient of the order of 100 MV/m are necessary to reach the required high energies within a reasonable machine length. One of the strictest requirements for such accelerating structures is a relatively low occurrence of vacuum arcs. 

CLIC prototype structures have been tested in the past, but only in absence of beam. In order to proof the feasibility of the high gradient technology for building a functional collider, it is necessary to understand the effect of the beam presence on the vacuum breakdowns. Tests of this type have never been performed previously. 

The goal of this work is to understand the effect of the beam presence in the accelerating cavity on the vacuum arcs. The setup, the experimental procedure and the results of the tests executed on a prototype accelerating cavity for the Main Beam of CLIC are described. 

The test were executed at CERN in the CLIC Test Facility 3 (CTF3), which houses a 12 GHz X-band Test Stand (XBOX). The XBOX supplies the radio-frequency power to the cavity prototype, while the beam is provided from the electron linac of the CTF3, reconfigured to produce a Main Beam-like pulse. 
During the analysis the differences between runs without beam and with different beam configurations will be presented.

This work offers a first glimpse on the beam effect on the breakdown rate. The experience gained on high gradient testing with beam lead to the proposal of some future developments to improve the experimental setup and the operation of the test stand. This will be precious in case the experiment will be replicated to complement and extend the results of this work.
